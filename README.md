APIs
This app relies on several APIs to fetch cricket data. You can either host your own JSON data or integrate live APIs for real-time data. Below are the APIs and their endpoints:

Live Scores API:

Endpoint: https://your-vercel-api-url/live-scores

Description: Fetches live scores of ongoing matches.

Player Stats API:

Endpoint: https://your-vercel-api-url/player-stats

Description: Fetches player statistics for Test, ODI, and T20 formats.

Team Info API:

Endpoint: https://your-vercel-api-url/team-info

Description: Fetches detailed information about cricket teams (rankings, recent performances, etc.).

JSON Structure for Local Hosting (Vercel)
To deploy the APIs on Vercel, you can create JSON files like:

live-scores.json: Contains data like current match status, teams, and scores.

player-stats.json: Includes player stats (batting, bowling, fielding for each format).

team-info.json: Contains details about each team (rankings, recent matches, etc.).

Make sure to update the URLs with your hosted Vercel endpoints.

Pages & Components
Pages
Home: The main landing page that showcases the live score updates and quick access to other sections.

Player Stats: Displays player statistics, allowing users to filter by team and format.

Recent Matches: Shows a list of recent cricket matches with scores and outcomes.

Team Info: Displays detailed profiles of cricket teams, including recent performances and rankings.

Footer: Displays basic footer information and links.

MatchCard: A card component used to display match scores and details in a user-friendly format.

PlayerCard: Used to display individual player statistics.

TeamCard: Displays a summary of team information.

Deployment
You can deploy both the frontend and backend (API) on Vercel.

Create separate Vercel projects for the frontend and API.

Push your JSON files (live scores, player stats, team info) to the API project.

Once deployed, make sure to update the API URLs in your frontend code to match the deployed endpoints.
